                        Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination,to be sorted into his house.

                        Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House Ghost. The founder of the House was Godric Gryffindor.Gryffindor corresponded to the element of fire.The common room was located in one of the highest towers at Hogwarts, the entrance was situated on the seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and was guarded by a portrait of The Fat Lady. She permitted entrance if given the correct password, which was changed numerous times throughout the school year.Famous Gryffindors included Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and Minerva McGonagall.The significant object of Gryffindor was the Sword of Gryffindor. Their motto was "Forti Animo Estote".                     </p>

                        The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold and its house point hourglass was filled with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House ghost.

Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house.The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.

                      The Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick.The ghost of Ravenclaw was the Grey Lady,who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House's founder.Ravenclaw corresponded to the element of air.The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories were located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories.This riddle, however, could be answered by non-Ravenclaws.Famous Ravenclaws included Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy Lockhart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander. The significant object of Ravenclaw was Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem, which was turned into a Horcrux by Tom Riddle.
                      The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick,and the House ghost was the Grey Lady,real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.          </p>

                        Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air,and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air.The Ravenclaw points hourglass contained blue sapphires.

Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth,and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds.Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.

                  Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin during the 1997–1998 school year, replacing Severus Snape, who as well replaced Slughorn as Potions Professor when he retired for the first time several years prior. Slytherin had produced the most Death Eaters and Dark wizards,including Tom Riddle,Bellatrix Lestrange and Lucius Malfoy, for example. But that does not mean that other Houses hadn't produced any; Peter Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, and Quirinus Quirrell was a Ravenclaw. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Many Slytherin students tended to clique together (often acquiring leaders) which further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and Tom Riddle's gang (which later became the Death Eaters).

                    The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted.Students of any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare.
